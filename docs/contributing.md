## Testing the documentation

If you want to edit and test the documentation prior to committing, there are a few easy steps to get you started.  
Below are outlined the main steps, but feel free to follow the [MkDocs documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation) or [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).

- Install Python 3+. Python 2.7 will not work.
- Install `pip`:
    `pip install --upgrade pip`
- Install Material for MkDocs via
    `pip install mkdocs-material`
- Clone the repository locally to a folder on your system.
- Edit the files. Once finished, run in the base folder (the one containing `mkdocs.yml`):
    `mkdocs serve`
