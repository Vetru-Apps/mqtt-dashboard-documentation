Shows and sends text strings.

When clicked, prompts the user to input a string to be sent to the selected output topic, while displaying the last received message on the input topic.

:   !!! warning
        If input and output topic are different, the tile won't be updated with the newly sent text, as tiles only get updated on incoming messages.

A prefix and a postfix can be selected to be displayed with the received text. These values won't be sent.
