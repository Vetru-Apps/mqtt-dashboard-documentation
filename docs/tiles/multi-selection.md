# Multi-selection

The multi-selection tile acts as a button, with the difference that more than one value can be saved during configuration to be later displayed to the user as choices.  

When clicked, the tile prompts the user to select a value from a pre-determined list of alias/payload pairs. A pair, as here intended, consists of an `alias` - a friendly name the user will read in the selection dialog - and a `payload` - the value that will be actually sent. 

You can chose whether or not to show the payload in the selection dialog. Similarly to the button, this tile does not accept inputs.
